## Project Description  

Emotion Plant Pot is an IoT-based educational prototype designed to make plant care interactive for children. The system monitors real-time environmental conditions and converts plant health data into simple emotional states (such as happy, thirsty, or uncomfortable).  

The objective is to promote environmental awareness, responsibility, and empathy through hands-on learning.

## Problem Statement  

Traditional plant care education methods lack interactivity and fail to maintain children's engagement. There is no real-time feedback mechanism that helps children understand plant needs clearly and intuitively.

---

## Solution  

This project introduces a smart plant pot that:

- Continuously monitors soil moisture, light intensity, and temperature  
- Processes sensor data using a microcontroller  
- Maps environmental conditions to emotional states  
- Displays plant “moods” visually  
- Encourages timely user interaction  

The focus is on education and habit-building rather than automation.

## System Architecture  

### Hardware Components  

- Microcontroller: Arduino / Raspberry Pi  
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor  
- LDR (Light Sensor)  
- DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)  
- OLED / LCD Display  

### Workflow  

1. Sensors collect environmental data.  
2. Microcontroller processes raw sensor values.  
3. Data is mapped to predefined emotional states.  
4. Emotional output is displayed on screen.  
5. Data can be logged for monitoring and educational tracking.

## Features  

- Real-time plant health monitoring  
- Emotion-based feedback system  
- Low-cost and safe prototype  
- Child-friendly interactive design  
- Suitable for schools and home learning environments

## Existing Systems and Limitations  

Current commercial smart planters are often:

- Expensive  
- Power-intensive  
- Over-automated  
- Less focused on educational outcomes  

Emotion Plant Pot addresses these limitations by prioritizing affordability, simplicity, and experiential learning.
